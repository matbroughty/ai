This endpoint can access all purchase item transactions for the Company, i.e. every transaction that makes up the current Purchase Ledger balance.    The query params allow selection of items by the Snapshot id for created, closed, updated, and deleted ID's.    Using this endpoint in conjunction with the Snapshot endpoints allows a detailed granular view of movements by Snapshot date.    **Note** If the Company is not configured to pull the Purchase Ledger Balance (Company.purchaseLedger) then these endpoints will return no or old data depending on when Purchase Ledger extraction was disabled.
